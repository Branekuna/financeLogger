A tutorial I used to learn about typescript/classes, and bundling with webpack. Had to remind myself of how to build HTML without using JSX.

To run it, first 'npm install', then:
1. either npm run build, and then open index.html with LiveServer (if using VSCode),
2. or 'npm run build' (optional) and then 'npm run serve', for webpack-dev-server.
